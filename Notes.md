1)intro

2)how to react?
    why?
        makes easy to manage and build complex frontend
    when?
        after javascript
        most projects dont need react in intial phase
    why react was created?
        ghost/phantom message problem
        no consistency in UI
    library vs framework-
        framework-military strict rules
        library-cool dude less strict rules
        REACT IS A LIBRARY
    topics-
        core state
        components resusability
        props
        hooks
        -------
        routers
        state management(redux)
        class based components
        BAAS apps(social media clones,e-commerce apps)
        why frameworks(nextJS)>react
            no SEO
            broswer rendering
            no routing
        
3)create react projects
    vite vs CRA
        vite- less time
              less packages installed
              faster
              better functionality
    react-
        react-dom
        react-native
        
4)Understand react flow and structure
    npm build and npm run dev are different
    build has
        html
        css 
        js
    React has
        make function and render it somewhere
        React breaks the UI into reusable, self-contained components (e.g., buttons, forms)
5)Creating your own library and JSX
