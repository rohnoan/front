2)how to react?
    why?
        makes easy to manage and build complex frontend
    when?
        after javascript
        most projects dont need react in intial phase
    why react was created?
        ghost/phantom message problem
        no consistency in UI
    library vs framework-
        framework-military strict rules
        library-cool dude less strict rules
        REACT IS A LIBRARY
    topics-
        core state
        components resusability
        props
        hooks
        -------
        routers
        state management(redux)
        class based components
        BAAS apps(social media clones,e-commerce apps)
        why frameworks(nextJS)>react
            no SEO
            broswer rendering
            no routing
